Algebraic representations of infinite matrix product states borrowed from computer science and linguistics

There is a direct connection between infinite matrix product states and constructions known as "finite state automata" in the fields of computer science and linguistics.  This connection is interesting not only because it provides yet another example of the parallel development of matrix product states in a different field, but also because it implies that Kleene's Theorem (sometimes called the "Fundamental Theorem" of regular languages) can be extended to apply to infinite matrix product states.  Specifically, it can be shown that every infinite matrix product state has a description using an extension of "regular expressions" (an algebra for describing weighted languages) and vice versa.  In this poster I will show the connection between infinite matrix product states and finite state automata, and I will furthermore present the algebraic formalism for representing infinite matrix product states that results from applying Kleene's Theorem in this context.
